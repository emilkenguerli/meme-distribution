1. Introduction
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This privacy policy explains our practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure.

Our service relies on external APIs (AWS Lambda and Imgflip) for its functionality. We do not share personal data with these services. For information on their data practices, please refer to their respective privacy policies.

4. Data Protection
We take the security of data seriously. Even though we do not collect personal data, we implement measures to protect any temporary data within our system.

5. User Rights
As we do not collect personal data, we do not hold any personal information about our users. If you have any concerns about your data rights, please contact us at [contact information].
